# Graphene-Oxide-Generator2
A tool to draw Graphene Oxide 3D chemical structures.(Python 3.6)

original code https://github.com/Ngtungfei/Graphene-Oxide-Generator2.git

small amendments by punkpony, 5th Feb 2020

- tidy up the look 
- fixed the problem of not displaying structures after first time

- possible not to remove edge/bulk carbons
- not compulsory to add -C=O and -COOH to the edges
- can choose to add -O- only or -OH only or both 



Would be nice to:
- output in .pdb or .gro
- allow for periodic surface
- only add -C=O and -COOH to internal holes, not on the edge of the box
